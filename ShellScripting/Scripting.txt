Scripting:

i write some series of commands, which i execute on a regular basis on a new machine when i log-in like
whoami
pwd
date
ls -l
cal

these are like a group of commands that we use on a daily basis

instead of writing the same set of commands again and again very often, we can keep all of them in a file and executing. instead of writing all commands again and again, we execute the file

Set of commands we save in a file for execution

Scripting is used to automate our daily routine work. repeated work

Instead of executing these commands one after the other manually, we can keep inside a file and execute that file -> this process is referred as Scripting

What's Shell scripting:
Process of executing the script file using Shell is called as "Shell scripting" ==> it will automate the usual or regular task in a project

we create shell script file with .sh extension.

currently which shell are we using? Bash is the default shell we are using

[ec2-user@newhost ~]$ echo $SHELL
/bin/bash

there are many shells available
[ec2-user@newhost ~]$ cat /etc/shells
/bin/sh
/bin/bash
/usr/bin/sh
/usr/bin/bash
/bin/csh
/bin/tcsh
/usr/bin/csh
/usr/bin/tcsh
[ec2-user@newhost ~]$

however, which is the default and mostly used shell out of all? is Bash

lets create a .sh file

[ec2-user@newhost ~]$ vi first-script.sh

write the following commands?
whoami
date
pwd
ls -l

[ec2-user@newhost ~]$ cat first-script.sh
whoami
date
pwd
ls -l


to execute the .sh file we use sh <file-name.sh>

[ec2-user@newhost ~]$ sh first-script.sh
ec2-user

/home/ec2-user
total 8
-rw-r--r--. 1 ec2-user ec2-user 52 Feb 22 22:13 alien.txt
-rw-r--r--. 1 ec2-user ec2-user 25 Feb 23 02:54 first-script.sh

How Scripting is different from Programming?
When we write code, we usually use Compilers, Interpreters to convert into machine understandable format. If it is a Java program, we have to compile into byte-code then convert into machine understandable format then give it to processor

Scripting: no compilation, no interpretation, directly executing in OS. Shell converts scripts into Kernel understandable format, then Kernel converts it into machine hardware understandable format

that's why they are different

Commands:
vi first-script.sh
i then write commands
ESC -> :wq
cat first-script.sh
sh first-script.sh
