mv alien.txt java.txt -> mv command to rename and move files

mv <present_name> <new_name> it will rename files

mv <present-location> <new-location> -> this will move file into devops folder:  mv java.txt devops

rm java.txt -> to delete a file

rm t*.txt 


[ec2-user@ip-172-31-5-197 ~]$ rmdir devops
rmdir: failed to remove 'devops': Directory not empty

cat > f1.txt -> it will create a file and we can add data (ctrl + D to come out of writing)
cat >> f1.txt -> append data to existing file
cat f2.txt -> check data or display data of file

Copy data: cp
cp f1.txt f2.txt -> f1 data will be added to f2. if there is any data in f2.txt, that will be replaced

Copy more than one file data into another file:
cat f1.txt f2.txt > f3.txt

cat -n f1.txt -> display data with numbering

tac f1.txt -> print file content from bottom to top
rev f1.txt -> reverse each line and each word of that line

cat f1.txt will display all content of that file
to display file data from top (default is 10 lines)
head f1.txt
head -n 5 f1.txt
tail -n 5 f1.txt
tail -f file.txt to get the live data
grep 'AWS' f1.txt -> print all lines having AWS keyword
grep -i 'aws' f1.txt -> print all lines having AWS ignoring case sensitivity
grep -n 'aws' f1.txt (print lines having aws with line number)
grep -v 'aws' f1.txt (prints lines which doesn't have aws keyword)
grep 'aws' * (search for aws keyword in all files of pwd)
wc f1.txt (num of lines, words, characters)

file creation in Linux:
mkdir <filename> create new directory file
touch: creates empty file
cat: creates file with data
cp: copy one file into another 
vi: create and open file for editing (vi f2.txt)

Reading file data:
cat: print file data from top to bottom cat <filename>
tac: print line data from bottom to top
rev: print each line and each word of that line in reverse order
head: print first 10 lines of file
tail: print last 10 lines
vi: open the file

Text editors in Linux:
visual editor -> vi (default editor in Linux)
other two options to create a new file: touch, cat
using vi we can create new files and we can modify existing files

vi demo.txt
vi command has 3 modes: 1. Command mode (just to open the file), 2. Insert mode (to edit the file -> press 'i'), 3. Escape mode (to come out of insert mode)
save and close: :wq
close file without saving: :q!

vi command will open the file if its available and if there is no file then it will create a new file and open that new file

to edit data, press 'i'

[ec2-user@ip-172-31-5-197 devops]$ vi demo.txt
