Linux architecture:

Linux is CLI based free and open source OS
It is secured
It is multi-user based OS
Highly recommended for project related servers (docker, Jenkins, k8s, nexus, sonar, webservers..)


3 components in architecture:
1. Hardware -> actual hardware that will execute everything and anything like Processor
2. Kernel -> next level is kernel
3. Shell -> last level



hardware -> encapsulated by Kernel -> encapsulated by Shell -> encapsulated by application or user

Shell -> is like a mediator between user and kernel. it is the one to process our commands. we are trying to write commands for the kernel. 
Kernel -> Program which read shell commands and gives to hardware

=> when we execute any Linux command, Shell will read our commands and translate our command into Kernel understandable format
=> Kernel software will convert our commands into Linux machine hardware understandable format
