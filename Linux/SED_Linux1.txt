Linux 3 notes

SED command -> Stream EDitor

say we have a collection of data, we can create a stream of it and double each value without affecting the original data

Data inside this file: vi -> insert 'i', escape 'esc'

Using SED command we can perform operations on file without having to open the file

for vi, we have to open the file first then edit and save

SED happens to be very powerful command in Linux, process the data (substitute, delete, insert)

sed 's/<OLD>/<NEW>/ filename ===> sed substitute line with Line. 's' tells sed to perform text replacement
sed 's/<OLD>/<NEW>/2' f1.txt ===> replace 2nd occurrence of old text with new text in every line
sed 's/<OLD>/<NEW>/g' f1.txt ===> replace all the occurrences of old text with new text every line
sed -i 's/<OLD>/<NEW>/g' f1.txt ===> 'i' ignore the cases, substitute and SAVE changes in the original file
sed -i '3d' f1.txt ===> deletes 3rd line from file permanently
sed -i '$d' f1.txt ===> deletes last line from file permanently
sed -i '<lineNumber>$d' f1.txt ===> deletes from nth line to last line in file
sed -i '3,6d' f1.txt ==> deletes from 3rd to 6th line
sed -n '/word/p' f1.txt ==> prints all lines which contains the keyword
sed -n '/Python/p' demo.txt --> prints all lines contains 'Python' keyword
sed '/Python/d' demo.txt ===> deletes all lines which contains 'Python' keyword
sed '$a\I am loving Linux commands' f1.txt ==> add given text after last line
 


's' means substitute 'line' with 'Line'
